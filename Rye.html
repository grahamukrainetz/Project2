        <h1 class="Bread_Name_Recipe">Rye Bread</h1>
        <h2 class="Bread_Hours">2 HRS</h2>
        <p class="Small_title"><b>Rye Bread: Recipe Ingredients</b></p>
        <p>4 ½ tsp. dry yeast</p>
        <p>2 ½ cups warm water</p>
        <p>⅔ cup molasses</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons caraway seeds</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon salt</p>
        <p>¼ cup vegetable oil</p>
        <p>¼ cup cocoa powder</p>
        <p>2 cups rye flour</p>
        <p>5 cups bread flour</p>
        
        <p class="Small_title"><b>Instructions</b></p>
        <p><b>1.</b> Dissolve the yeast in the warm water with the molasses. Put yeast mixture into a large metal bowl.</p>
        <p><b>2.</b> Add the caraway seeds, salt, vegetable oil, cocoa powder, 2 cups of rye flour and then 2 cups of bread flour, mixing into the yeast mixture after each addition with a wooden spoon.</p>
        <p>Add more bread flour, a cup at a time, until the dough is not so sticky and it is too hard to mix it with the wooden spoon. At that point, spread a half cupful of flour onto a large, clean, flat surface and put the dough onto the surface.</p>
        <p><b>3.</b> Knead the dough by pressing down with the heel of your hand, stretching it, turning the dough a quarter-turn, pulling the dough back toward you and then pressing and stretching again. Knead additional bread flour into the dough until it reaches the right consistency. Knead for 5-7 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic.</p>
        <p><b>4.</b> Spread some vegetable oil around a large bowl and place the dough in it, turning it so it gets coated in the oil.</p>
        <p>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp cloth. Let rise at room temperature until it has doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</p>
        <p><b>5.</b> Gently press down on the risen dough so some of its air is released. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, knead the dough a few turns and then divide it by cutting it in half with a sharp knife.</p>
        <p><b>6.</b> Shape each half into loaf. Place dough loafs into either oiled 8x4-inch bread loaf pans, or onto a flat baking sheet or peel that has been sprinkled with corn meal, depending if you want to cook the loaves in pans or directly on a baking stone. Cover with plastic or a damp cloth.</p>
        <p><b>7.</b> Let the bread rise again, this time not doubling in volume, but rising by about half of its volume, about 30 to 45 minutes, half as long as the first rising. The dough should be peeking over the top of the loaf pan if using a loaf pan.</p>
        <p><b>8.</b> If you are using a baking stone, place the stone in the oven. Preheat oven to 350°F for at least half an hour before baking.</p>
        <p><b>9.</b> If baking on a stone and not in the pan, score the loaves a few times on the top of the dough right before putting it in the oven.</p>
        <p>Put loaves in the oven. If you have a mister, mist the dough with a little water the first 10 minutes of baking. Bake for 40-50 minutes, or until done. The bread should sound hollow when tapped.</p>
